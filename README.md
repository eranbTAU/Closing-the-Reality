# Closing-the-Reality-Gap-for-a-Multi-Agent-System-Using-GAN
Controlling autonomous robots can be a difficult and tedious process, which requires exertion in building the robots and a learning process that can be complex. The learning
process can also be complex as a result of the number of robots that can be learned, the process requires a lot of real-world data for the learning of the robot to be efficient. The problem can be solved by using a simulation that simulates the real world and allows the robot to learn faster and more efficiently. In addition, several robots can be taught simultaneously. The problem of transfer from simulation to the real world is known as the simto-real gap. Today, the reality gap is still a challenging problem.
In this paper, we propose a methodology to leverage the RealSim-Real framework. We build several autonomous robots to acquire data from the real world. The data was collected from the robot during a random travel process in the real world, the data containing the action and state of the robots. We propose a Deep Neural-Network architecture termed CR-Net based on Long short-term memory (LSTM), Convolutional neural network (CNN), and fully connected (FC). The CRNet is trained over data collected from two robots, one for the train and the other one for the test. In addition, we train with the real world data a Vanilla GAN to generate synthetic data. The trained Vanilla GAN is examined and shows 0.021(mm) position error with CR-Net as a prediction model. The idea is to train the GAN based on the training data and later inquire the GAN to generate possible actions and states giving random noise. Furthermore, with the Vanilla GAN, we can skip the acquired data stage, by actually creating a simulator that produces data. We show that the proposed network can
predict the next state of the robot given the actions and the network was able to get a position error of 0.023(mm) on
real data. After the model was trained, we apply the model in the simulation to increase the number of the train robots and we demonstrate on multi-agent task that learned policy from simulation and transferred to the real world. The potential applications of this work would be way finding and navigation
for robots and autonomous vehicles.
