# Real-to-Sim-to-Real: Learning Models for Homogeneous Multi-Agent Systems

Training Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies for a robot requires an extensive amount of data recorded while interacting with the environment. Acquiring such a policy on a real robot is a tedious and time consuming task. It may also cause mechanical wear and pose danger. This is more challenging in a multi-agent system where individual data is required from each agent. While training in simulations is the common approach due to efficiency and low-cost, they rarely describe the real world. Consequently, policies trained in simulations and transferred to the real robot usually perform poorly. In this letter, we present a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework to bridge the reality gap for homogeneous multi-agent systems. First, we propose a novel deep neural-network architecture termed Convolutional-Recurrent Network (CR-Net) to simulate agents. CR-Net includes convolutional, recurrent and fully-connected layers aimed to capture the complex transition of an agent. Once trained with data from one agent, we show that the CR-Net can also accurately predict motion of other agents in the group. Second, we propose to invest a limited amount of real data from one agent in a generative model. Then, training the CR-Net with synthetic data sampled from the generative model is shown to be at least equivalent to real data. The generative model can also be disseminated along with open-source hardware for easier usage. Using the models, we build a simulation that is based solely on data from one agent. We show experiments on ground and underwater vehicles in which multi-agent RL policies are trained in the simulation and successfully transferred to the real-world.
